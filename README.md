# GUI_FoxLi_Simulation_of_COIL_Unstable_Resonator
A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) that uses the Fox-Li method to simulate unstable resonators for COIL systems and displays the intensity and phase profiles of the beams in real time as the iteration goes on. Choose simulation parameters, misalign mirrors, load an experimental gain profile, and perform far-field analysis to assure output beam quality.
