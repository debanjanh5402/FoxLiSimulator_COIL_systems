# GUI_FoxLi_Simulation_of_COIL_Unstable_Resonator
This Python GUI simulates unstable resonators using the Fox-Li method for COIL systems. It features real-time visualisation of the beam's intensity and phase profiles, with options to choose simulation parameters, misalign the mirrors and load an experimental gain profile. It concludes with a far-field analysis to ensure output beam quality.
